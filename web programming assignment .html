          <p> Many novice writers tend to make a sharp distinction between content and style, thinking that a paper can be strong in one and weak in the other </p>
          <p>if there isn’t a careful, coherent argument to give the text meaning. Paragraphs are the “stuff ” of academic writing and, thus, worth our attention here.</p>
         
          <p> but focusing on organization shows how content and style converge in deliberative academic writing. Your professors will view even the most elegant prose as rambling and tedious</p>
